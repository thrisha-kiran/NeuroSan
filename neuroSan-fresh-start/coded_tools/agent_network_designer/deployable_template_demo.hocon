# Template for assembly of agent_network_designer networks that are deployable
# via neuro-san Reservations. Any tool in the tools section might be replicated
# and {strings} replaced with salient information from the agent_network_designer.
# Note that we are not including aaosa.hocon in here as we have to do subsitutions in code
# in order for the networks to be deployment-ready.

    # the "commondefs" -> "replacement_strings" section and

    # Note that if "demo_mode" is not int the base template, this will
    # simply add it. It has no effect on any other fields of "commondefs"
    # or other parts of the template.
