class GoogleSerper(CodedTool):
    """
    CodedTool implementation which provides a way to do website search by Google Serper

    Search the web using Google Serper API with customizable parameters.

        Supports multiple search types (web, news, images, places) with geographic and language localization.
        Returns structured search results with metadata for easy processing.

        Available parameters:
        - query (required): The search term or question to look up online
        - type (optional): Search type - 'search' (default, general web), 'news', 'images', or 'places'
        - k (optional): Number of results to return (default: 10)
        - gl (optional): Country code for geographic localization (default: 'us', e.g., 'uk', 'de', 'fr')
        - hl (optional): Language code for search interface (default: 'en', e.g., 'es', 'fr', 'de')
        - tbs (optional): Time-based search filter (e.g., 'qdr:d' for past day, 'qdr:w' for past week, or
                          'qdr:m' for past month)

        Use this for: real-time web information, news searches, location-based queries, and when you need
        fresh data not available in the AI model's training data.

                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    "query" the query to search for.

                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
