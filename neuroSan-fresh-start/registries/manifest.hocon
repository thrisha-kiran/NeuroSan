    # Tool integration examples

    # To use this agent network with Brave Search, obtain an API key from: https://brave.com/search/api/
    # Once you have the API key, set it using the BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable.
    # You can optionally set a custom search URL via the BRAVE_URL environment variable.
    # If BRAVE_URL is not set, the default is: https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=
    # You can also configure the request timeout (in seconds) using BRAVE_TIMEOUT; the default is 30 seconds.
    "tools/brave_search.hocon": false,

    # To use this search tool, you must
    #
    # 1. Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE)
    #   * Go to  https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
    #   * Click "Add" → Choose sites or use "*" to search the whole web (then enable that in settings).
    #   * Note your Search Engine ID (cx).
    # 2. Get Google API key
    #  * Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
    #  * Enable the Custom Search API.
    #  * Create an API key under APIs & Services > Credentials.
    #
    # Use the CSE ID in step 1 to set GOOGLE_SEARCH_CSE_ID environment variable.
    # Use the API key in step 2 to set GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY environment variable.
    #
    # You can optionally set a custom search URL and a custom timeout via the GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL and GOOGLE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT environment variables.
    # Otherwise, the default values of "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1" and "30" are used, respectively

    # Demos

    # This agent network performs the following actions:
    # 1. Calls "agent_network_designer" as an external agent to generate a .hocon configuration file.
    # 2. Uses the "agent_network_html_generator" tool (from the toolbox) to create an HTML visualization of the network.
    # 3. Demonstrates how the generated network works by calling the coded tool "NsflowSelenium".
    # 4. Sends an email with the .hocon and HTML files attached using the "gmail_with_attachment" tool (also from the toolbox).
    #
    # Requirements:
    # - neuro-san>=0.5.38
    # - Install Gmail support:
    #     pip install -U langchain-google-community\[gmail\]
    # - Set up Gmail API credentials:
    #     Follow the instructions at
    #     https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application
    #     Then download the `credentials.json` file and place it at the top level of this repo.
    # - Install Selenium and WebDriver Manager:
    #     pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    #
    # Additional setup for running the "NsflowSelenium" coded tool:
    # - Start the nsflow service in a separate terminal.
    # - Use non-default ports for the neuro-san gRPC, HTTP, and nsflow servers.
    #   The default ports are 30011 for gRPC, 8080 for HTTP, and 4173 for nsflow.
    #   For example, you can run:
    #     python -m run --server-grpc-port 30012 --server-http-port 8081 --nsflow-port 4174
