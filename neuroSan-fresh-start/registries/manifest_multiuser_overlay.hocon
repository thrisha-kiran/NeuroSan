    # This manifest file lists agent networks that we do *not* want to serve up
    # in a multi-user deployment.  The idea is that the main manifest.hocon is
    # what most developers will want to use in their nsflow-based dev environments,
    # and that one grows organically as we add new agent networks.
    #
    # However, every once in a while someone develops an agent network that does not scale up
    # well to a multi-user deployment just yet, so we add those here as they arise until
    # they are ready to be included in the main manifest.
    #
    # Most often these special networks are put together with a bent towards the client having
    # knowledge of specific server details, which is fine for a single-developer setup,
    # but a big no-no for a multi-user setup. Properties of these special networks
    # include but are not limited to:
    #
    #   1. Knowledge or modification of the server's local filesystem.
    #   2. Have specific external account settings that are not generally available.
    #   3. Makes use of tools that execute external processes via shell commands.
    #   4. Requires use of external services not readily deployed by the average bear
    #      (like databases)
    #
    # To use this file, we simply add a reference to it at the end of our existing
    # AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE specification # like this:
    #
    #    export AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE="registries/manifest.hocon registries/manifest_multiuser_overlay.hocon"
    #
    # Basically the data for later manifest files gets overlayed on top of earlier ones.
