# The schema specifications for this file are documented here:

# Requirement to use this agent network:
# - google-genai package installed
# - GOOGLE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable set
# See https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs
# Note: If `langchain-google-genai` is already installed in your environment, `google-genai` is already included.

    # modifying the configuration for each agent network.
